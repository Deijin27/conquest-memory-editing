# Conquest Memory Editing

A collection of lua scripts (and maybe action replay codes in the future)
to edit the memory of Pokemon Conquest in Desmume.

To use the lua scripts in desmume.
1. Load the game
2. Tools > lua scripting > New Lua Script Window
3. Browse > find the script file. It should be run automatically from there

Later times, it should appear in the history on the Tools > lua scripting menu, so you can just click that.
